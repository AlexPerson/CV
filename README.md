# CV

I am a junior mobile software developer, strategic planner and digital creative.  I have a background working with and studying eCommerce, Digital Media, and most recently Software Engineering.
I am passionate about using technology to create engaging and meaningful experiences that bring people together in new and exciting ways.

## Skills

### Software Engineering

While I am somewhat of a novice when it comes to development, I have been building applications with Ruby, Javascript, Objective C, and recently Swift and aim to develop this skillset much further. I am currently searching for a junior role as a mobile developer.

### Public Speaking and Presentations

I love preparing and delivering presentations, especially if it’s for a project I am proud of and believe in.

### Research

After analysing a brief, the first step is to identify key insights to form the foundation for generating ideas and concepts to best meet the goals of the project.  I have gained experience from North Kingdom finding these insights for clients like Lego, Disney, and Hermés through using surveys, focus groups, workshops, and general Googling.

### Digital Strategy and Planning

Using these key insights, I have experience shaping defining digital strategies to meet the needs of clients in a variety of industries.

### Conceptualisation and Ideation

Great ideas come from many ideas and over the course of my education I have learned relevant tools and methods to generate ideas and combine the best parts to develop insight-based concepts.

### Team Development

I have experience creating effective teams from their formation to termination, bringing a team from one stage of development to the next by setting clear expectations, facilitating team development sessions, giving and receiving effective feedback, and never forgeting that HOW we work is often as important as WHAT we do.
